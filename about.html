        My Travel Diary is a private retailer or public service that provides travel and tourism-related services to the general public on behalf of accommodation or travel suppliers. Travel agencies can provide outdoor recreation activities, airlines, car rentals, cruise lines, hotels, railways, travel insurance, package tours, insurance, guide books, public transport timetables, car rentals, and bureau de change services. Travel agencies can also serve as general sales agents for airlines that do not have offices in a specific region. A travel agency's main function is to act as an agent, selling travel products and services on behalf of a supplier. They do not keep inventory in-hand unless they have pre-booked hotel rooms or cabins on a cruise ship for a group travel event such as a wedding, honeymoon, or other group event.<br><br>

    ne travel expert throughout
    Many agencies force you to deal with multiple people throughout the booking process, making it disjointed and impersonal. At Crystal Travel you will deal with the same travel expert from the moment of initial contact until you are safely back at home.

    <br> When booking a vacation, it is always better value to book an air-inclusive packages. Many travel agencies are unable to offer this. Crystal Travel & Tours works with most all international airlines and  frequently offers the most competitive fares for travel to Ireland,Britain and Europe.

    Unlike many other agencies who do their business solely online or even from abroad, we still keep regular office hours and are delighted when with planned visits or drop-ins to our West Roxbury office.
    We insist on prompt and pleasant customer service and the best hotels, visitor attractions and entertainment. By sharing with you the hidden places not mentioned in guidebooks, the local people you wouldnâ€™t otherwise meet and the traditions you may not have experienced by yourself, we ensure that you get an authentic and enhanced experience you simply could not have had on your own.
